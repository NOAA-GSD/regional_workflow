# HWT Ensemble

## Description

The ensemble for the HWT Spring Experiment 2021 is a 9 member forecast
ensemble run to 60 hours at 00 UTC daily. It is run on the North
American (NA) 3km domain, and mixes in ICS/LBCS external models and
pertubations, multiple physics packages, and multiple stochastic physics
approaches to acheive a more desirable spread in forcasts. The sections
below provide details of the variations among members.


## ICS/LBCS
The ICS and LBCS come from both the GFS and GEFS using 6 hour forecasts
from 18 UTC as follows:

  - Members 1-3 have GFS ICS/LBCS
  - Members 4-6 have GEFS Member 01 ICS/LBCS
  - Members 7-9 have GEFS Member 02 ICS/LBCS

Below, these sets will be referred to as "sub-ensembles".

## Physics

Each sub-ensemble will run with varying physics in each member. Here is
an example of the GFS sub-ensemble, and the same pattern applies to
each sub-ensemble:

  - Member 1: rrfs_thompson_mynn CCPP Suite
  - Member 2: GFSv16 (without parameterized convection)
  - Member 3: ???


## Stochastic perturbations

Each sub-ensemble will be treated with the same stochastic
perturbations for all members:

  - Members 1-3: None
  - Members 4-6: SPPT
  - Members 7-9: SPPT/SHUM/SKEB

# Configuring the ensemble

The configuration layer doesn't currently handle this type of mixed
ensemble. Instead there is a manual method to do this work:

1. Configure each sub-ensemble using different RUN and NET variables
(RRFS_NA_GFS, RRFS_NA_GEFS01, RRFS_NA_GEFS02)

  - Each configuration stage will generate 3 namelists with varying
  seed values for stochastic physics. 
2. Turn on each rocotorun job in the crontab.
